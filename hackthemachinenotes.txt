Dimensionality Reduction
Two mistakes:
	Using PCA to reduce over-fitting
		- "Throws away" features and overfits model
		- Use regularization method insteal
	Automatically using PCA as part of the process
		- May work, better to start with all the
		  data and introduce PCA as needed

Anomaly Detection
	A learning algorithm that tries to identify points
	  that do not belong
	Anomaly detection falls under the umbrella of
	  unsupervised learning, since we lack an
	  outcome of value
	Choosing features is easier if we can evalute the
	  model
		- Typically, one uses a dataset of 
		  labeled anomalous and non-anomalous
	  	  examples to build a model and evaluate
		  it
	Anomaly detection resembles supervised learning but
	   is inherently different:
		- Skewed data
		- Possibility of many different kinds of
		  anomalies which make it figgicult for an
		  algorithm to learn from the few positive
		  examples what an anomaly looks like
		- future anomalies might look totally 
		  different

Anomaly detection considerations
	Features are critical in anomaly detection
	The assumption in anomaly detection is that the 
	  features have gaussian distribution
		- Transformations may help (log e)
	The goal is to use features that take unusually
	  large or small values in the event of an anomaly
		- Consider combining two correlated
		  features
	Evaluating performance of anomaly detection algorithms
	  requires care
	Because the data is very skewed towards non-anomalous
	  points, an accuracy measure is not a good evaluat-
	  ion.
		- Consider precision, recall F1 score and
		  others
		- Confusion matrix

The Navy's ICAS Challenge
	"How can we use data science and machine learning
	  to improve our predictive maintenance and avoid
	  system downtime?"
	Suggestion: Spend time getting to know the data
		- Know what the variables measure
		- Visualize the data
		- Make the data useful - wrangle
	Get smart on what an anomaly would look like, or
	  what would be a cause for concern
		- Finite duration
		- Trends
	Spend more time with the data than with the
	  algorithms - be patient!
	Don't bite off too much; use what you can see in
	  and what you learn about these systems to help
	  focus on a tractable problem
